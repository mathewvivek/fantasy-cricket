<h2>Welcome to the Fun Cricket App! </h2>

of our club pick who they think will perform well, consistently over the
season. </p>

<h2>How do I start a team?</h2>

<p>Anyone may log on to the website to view the League table </p>

<p>
Once you have logged on you can create your team and pick players.  You have to pick 11 players according to the rules below, nominate one player as captain, one player as keeper, and you have to Validate your team.  Your captain will score double points for your team.  Your keeper will gain points for batting, but not for bowling (since he is keeping).  Once the team has been validated, you are ready for the game. </p>

<h2>Rules for making a team</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Teams must consist of 11 players.</li>
	<li>Each team must have: 3 batsmen, 3 bowlers and 3 all-rounders.</li>
	<li>One team member must be nominated as the captain.  He scores double.</li>
	<li>One team member must be nominated as the keeper.  This team member will not
	    collect any points from bowling.</li>
	<li>Each team will be allowed to make 1 substitution per week. </li>
	<li>When substitutions are made, the points that the exiting player has accrued up until that date, will remain with the team. The incoming player will then start gaining points from that date. Points earned before being selected will not be transferred over.</li>
	<li>Substitutions must be made each day after 6:00 PM </li>
	<li>Special rules will apply in the case of abandonned matches. </li>
</ul>
